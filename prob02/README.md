# Find the Errors
In this program, you will debug a program that contains compile time and logical errors.

## main.cpp
1. Try compiling the program to find out what errors the compiler finds.
1. Find and fix the compile time error(s).
1. Once the program compiles, try running it to see whether it outputs the expected results.
1. Find and fix any bug(s) in the program that are causing incorrect results to be output.

# Hints
1. Feel free to use labex01 prob02 as an example of cin/cout and computations.
1. The compiler outputs the line number and column of the error if a compile time error is encountered
   e.g., `main.cpp:27:37` indicates an error on line 27, column 37
1. Try running the program with different widths and heights, and ensure it is calculating the area correctly with each of the different input values.

# Sample Output
```
What is the room's "width" in feet? 11.5
What is the room's "length" in feet? 17.8
The "area" of the room is 204.7 square feet.
```
